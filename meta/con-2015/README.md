Slides and whatever else for a RacketCon talk.


Outline (2015-07-21)
---

- Here's what I did, isn't racket cool? You can do it too.
- touch all the bases: graphs, greek letters
- require ipoe

Improvements (2015-08-27)
---

- Begin: Microsoft Word is a great tool for composing essays
- killer apps: spellcheck & grammar check
- (Show of hands, how many lines in a sonnet?
   Trick question, depends on italian/english -- right?.
   Anyway maybe people in the 1600s could remember all this,
   kinda like how people in the '90s could remember phone numbers,
   but I'm always on Wikipedia when writing poems.)
