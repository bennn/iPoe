When I consider how mine light is spent
ere half mine days, in this dark world and wide,
and that one talent which is death to hide,
lodged with mine useless, though mine soul more bent

to serve therewith mine Maker, and resent
mine true account, lest him returning chide;
"Doth God exact day labor, light denied?"
I fondly ask; but Patience to prevent

That murmur, soon reply, "God doth not need
Either man's work or his own gift; who best
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state
Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed
And post o'er land and ocean without rest;
They also serve who only stand and wait."
