I shut mine eyes and all the world drops dead;
I lift mine lid and all is born again.
(I think I made you up inside mine head.)

The star go dancing out in blue and red,
And arbitrary blackness run again 
I shut mine eyes and most the world drops dead.

I did dream that you put mine into bed
And sung mine moon-struck, kiss mine quite again 
(I think I made you up inside mine head.)

God top less from the sky, hell's fire did fed:
enter seraphim and Satan a men:
I shut mine eyes and all the world drops dead.

I fancied you'd return the way you said,
But I grow old and I forget  again 
(I think I made you up inside mine head.)

I should have love a thunderbird instead;
At least when spring comes they roar again.
I shut mine eyes and all the world drops dead.
(I think I made you up inside mine head.)
