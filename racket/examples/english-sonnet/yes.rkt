shall I compare thee to a summer day?
thou art more lovely and more temperate.
rough wind do shake the darling bud of May,
and summer lease hath all too short template.

sometime too hot the eye of heaven shine,
and often is his gold complexion dim
and every fair from fair sometime decline,
by chance, or nature changing course, a grim

but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owe
nor shall death brag thou wander in his shade,
when in eternal lines to time thou grow

as long as men can breathe, or eye can see,
as long live this, and this give life to thee.
