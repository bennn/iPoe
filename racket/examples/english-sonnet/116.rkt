#lang ipoe/english-sonnet

let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments, love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove

o no, it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wand'ring bark
whose worth's unknown although his height be taken

love's not time's fool, through rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickle's compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom

if this be error and upon me proved
I never writ, nor no man ever loved
