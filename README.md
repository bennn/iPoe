iPoe

Django version of the interactive poetry editor.

Last modified Summer 2014. Status:
- Basic UI working
- Many poetic forms enforced
- NOTHING for syllable and rhyme checking
- Wrote scrapers to collect words & rhymes as text (not even SQL)

This branch will likely stay dead.
It was a nice chance to prototype and learn some Django.
